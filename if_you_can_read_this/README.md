The idea for this Kata came from 9gag today [here][1].

You'll have to translate a string to Pilot's alphabet (NATO phonetic alphabet) [wiki][2].

Like this:

**Input:** If you can read

**Output:** India Foxtrot Yankee Oscar Uniform Charlie Alfa November Romeo Echo Alfa Delta

**Some notes**

Keep the punctuation, and remove the spaces.

Use Xray without dash or space.
